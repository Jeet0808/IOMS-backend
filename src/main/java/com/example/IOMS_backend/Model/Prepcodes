     so we are going to add the product class,
     so we need to write pseudo code first, so that we can write code with ease and make sure to use ,
     unit tests, by just asigning soem default or test values
     So to do that we can go with a pattern which is :
     1. create and make write list of instance variable needed.
     2. make constructor and use default value for each time object created.
     3.make getters and setters methodes for efficiant and ease and for securly ,
     accesing of instance variable. by mvc.
     4. make sure to use validation at first priority.
     5.to use good return or response messages.

     So this are the core essential things we need to cover in our first
     phase of development

     #1. Instance variable.
     ProductName,ProductPrice,Productcategory,
     Productsellername,ProductSellerContacts,
     ProductDiscription , ProductDetails,
     productRating,productReview, ImgUrl

     **OK so this are the main stats of a product we dicused yet.
     We also need images and vedios of product that we will disccuses later.**
     but for now we can assign url of images or vedios.
     so add one more instance variable named -: ImgUrl


     #2. Constructor
      1.in constructor we will assign some default values + assigning each time at product image creation.
      2. We needed to add validation at constructor so that the product object should follow the
         strict rules :-

            2. price should be greater then zero and less then the long data type.
               so check the product price when storing and assigning the product.
            3. productcategory should be within the category list we are providing.
               or can if not selected that what we are providing than asign it to the general category.
            4. sellername and seller contacts are aoutomatically fetched from the seller when he/she going
               to add product and  aoutomatically stored in instance variable .
            5. productdetails and discription both are string so seller can add what ever according to them.
            (not more then 250 words).
            6. product rating we be change acc to the user counts that if anyone give it rating then it
               will be updated acc to the avg counting of all rating to 5.
            7. product review can be given by customers if they like the product it will be as an comment section
                again it was also a string.(not more then 250 words.)
            8. product image url can be as an string which will be added by seller at the time of adding product.


     3. Methods
      we neeed all getters and setters so that we can perform our buiesness logic.
